# MusicSync
A project by Liam Ye and Henderson Harper for DeltaHacks XI

We created a project that would give a song recommendation based on the user's current mood and activity.
This project uses the OpenAI API and the YouTube Data API. The OpenAI API generates a YouTube search query based on the user's inputted mood and activity, and the YouTube Data API returns a YouTube video of music corresponding to the search query.

For example, when the user inputted that they were feeling sad and they were studying, the search query generated by the OpenAI API (using GPT-4o) was "epic instrumental music for studying and reflection". This query was then fed into the Youtube Data API and resulted in the video "6 Hours of the The Best Epic Inspirational Music for Studying and Working" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lovYZqGVPBQ).

Generative AI was used in the creation of this project.
